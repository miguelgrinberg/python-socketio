Getting Started
===============

What is Socket.IO?
------------------

Socket.IO is a transport protocol that enables real-time bidirectional
event-based communication between clients (typically, though not always,
web browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client
and server components are written in JavaScript. This package provides
Python implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.

Version compatibility
---------------------

The Socket.IO protocol has been through a number of revisions, and some of these
introduced backward incompatible changes, which means that the client and the
server must use compatible versions for everything to work.

If you are using the Python client and server, the easiest way to ensure compatibility
is to use the same version of this package for the client and the server. If you are
using this package with a different client or server, then you must ensure the
versions are compatible.

The version compatibility chart below maps versions of this package to versions
of the JavaScript reference implementation and the versions of the Socket.IO and
Engine.IO protocols.

+------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| JavaScript Socket.IO version | Socket.IO protocol revision | Engine.IO protocol revision | python-socketio version | python-engineio version |

Client Examples
---------------

The example that follows shows a simple Python client:

.. code:: python

    import socketio

    sio = socketio.Client()

    @sio.event
    def connect():
        print('connection established')

    @sio.event
    def my_message(data):
        print('message received with ', data)
        sio.emit('my response', {'response': 'my response'})

    @sio.event
    def disconnect():
        print('disconnected from server')

    sio.connect('http://localhost:5000')
    sio.wait()

Below is a similar client, coded for ``asyncio`` (Python 3.5+ only):

.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    import socketio

    sio = socketio.AsyncClient()

    @sio.event
    async def connect():
        print('connection established')

    @sio.event
    async def my_message(data):
        print('message received with ', data)
        await sio.emit('my response', {'response': 'my response'})

    @sio.event
    async def disconnect():
        print('disconnected from server')

    async def main():
        await sio.connect('http://localhost:5000')
        await sio.wait()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        asyncio.run(main())

Client Features
---------------

- Can connect to other Socket.IO servers that are compatible with the
  JavaScript Socket.IO 1.x and 2.x releases. Work to support release 3.x is in
  progress.
- Compatible with Python 3.6+.
- Two versions of the client, one for standard Python and another for
  asyncio.
- Uses an event-based architecture implemented with decorators that
  hides the details of the protocol.
- Implements HTTP long-polling and WebSocket transports.
- Automatically reconnects to the server if the connection is dropped.

Server Examples
---------------

The following application is a basic server example that uses the Eventlet
asynchronous server:

.. code:: python

    import eventlet
    import socketio

    sio = socketio.Server()
    app = socketio.WSGIApp(sio, static_files={
        '/': {'content_type': 'text/html', 'filename': 'index.html'}
    })

    @sio.event
    def connect(sid, environ):
        print('connect ', sid)

    @sio.event
    def my_message(sid, data):
        print('message ', data)

    @sio.event
    def disconnect(sid):
        print('disconnect ', sid)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        eventlet.wsgi.server(eventlet.listen(('', 5000)), app)

Below is a similar application, coded for ``asyncio`` (Python 3.5+ only) and the
Uvicorn web server:

.. code:: python

    from aiohttp import web
    import socketio

    sio = socketio.AsyncServer()
    app = web.Application()
    sio.attach(app)

    async def index(request):
        """Serve the client-side application."""
        with open('index.html') as f:
            return web.Response(text=f.read(), content_type='text/html')

    @sio.event
    def connect(sid, environ):
        print("connect ", sid)

    @sio.event
    async def chat_message(sid, data):
        print("message ", data)

    @sio.event
    def disconnect(sid):
        print('disconnect ', sid)

    app.router.add_static('/static', 'static')
    app.router.add_get('/', index)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        web.run_app(app)

Server Features
