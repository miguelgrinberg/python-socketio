django-socketio
===============

This is an example Django application integrated with Socket.IO.

You can run it with the Django development web server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

When running in this mode, you will see a warning indicating that the WebSocket
transport is not available, which is not supported by this web server.

See the documentation for information on supported deployment methods that you
can use to add support for WebSocket.
